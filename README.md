# Run,Boy,Run (Behind the scene)
![alt text](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzEyMzgzMDYucG5n/original/JOw58%2F.png "Banner of Run,Boy,Run")

**This is the main game logic behind my game ["Run.Boy,Run"](https://devplayrepeat.itch.io/runboyrun), follow the link for free download.**

Clone the repository, open the project in Unity, load the "Start" scene and press "Play". A minimalistic version of Run,Boy,Run should be started. There is no main menu nor a game over screen. So if you loose you have to stop the game in Unity and start again. 

In the game itself I use some assets for the main graphics which I'm not allowed to share, therefor I have replaced those by simple objects provided by Unity.

Three free available assets from the Unity asset store are included:
* VRTK (https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK) - MIT licensed
* SteamVR plugin for Unity (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/steamvr-plugin-32647)
* TextMesh PRO (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126)

Feel free to use my code in your project, all scripts in the "_Scripts" folder are released under the MIT license.
